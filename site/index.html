                  <q>Fragrant with the spicy aromas of clove, coriander and citrus, Quick Wit is a Belgian-style wheat ale with a beautiful golden straw hue and a solid white head. Hints of banana and clove combine with a gentle citrus and wheat tang, ending with a dry pepper and fruit finish. Dried sweet and bitter orange peels are used along with coriander to bring out the subtle nuances of citrus and spice to complement the malt and yeast.The Keynote Speaker is Big Hops with Five Malts to bring in the balance.

A huge THANKS to Paul Cebar for letting us use the name from his album Sucha Much. A cask of Sorachi Ace blended with a kettle sour that our brewers have been playing with. They also added some blackberries for good measure. It’s tart, but not mouth puckeringly so.  Delicious, refreshing, and definitely won’t last long!  </q>
